Picked a few misc. exercises from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/master/100%2B%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises.txt

1. Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits (Question 13)
```
def counter(text):
    letters = 0
    digits = 0
    for i in list(text):
        if i.isalpha():
            digits += 1
        elif i.isdigit():
            letters += 1
    print("Letters: {}".format(letters))
    print("Digits: {}".format(digits))
```

2. Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. (Question 8)
```
orig = "without,hello,bag,world"
items = orig.split(",")
items.sort()
new = ",".join(items)
```

3. Check password for criteria (Question 18 modified)
- At least 1 letter between [a-z]
- At least 1 number between [0-9]
- At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
- At least 1 character from [$#@]
- Minimum length of transaction password: 6
- Maximum length of transaction password: 12
```
special = list("$#@")

def pw_check(n):
    haslower = False
    hasupper = False
    hasnumber = False
    hasspecial = False
    if 5 < len(n) <13:
        for i in list(n):
            if not haslower and i.islower():
                haslower = True
            elif not hasupper and i.isupper():
                hasupper = True
            elif not hasnumber and i.isdigit():
                hasnumber = True
            elif not hasspecial and i in special:
                hasspecial = True

        if haslower and hasupper and hasnumber and hasspecial:
            print("PW valid")
        else:
            print("PW invalid")
    else:
        print("PW length invalid")
  ```
