## Luhn's check for credit card validity

#### Steps:
  - From second to last digit, multiply every other digit by 2
  - Store sum of digits from prior result to sum
  - If digit > 9 then digit = digit - 9 and store to sum
  - Store sum of unused digits to sum (invert previous method used)
  - If sum % 10 = 0 then valid card
  - Finally, create as function and prompt for input

#### Step 1 brainstorm
#sum every other number right to left
(num = _some number_)
```
num_list = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
(sum(num_list[::-2]))
```
#same, but starting from second to last number
```
start_index = len(num_list) - 2
(sum(num_list[start_index::-2]))
```
