## Luhn's check for credit card validity
- Operators
- Enumerate
- Looping through list

#### Steps:
  - From second to last digit, multiply every other digit by 2
  - Store sum of digits from prior result to sum
  - If digit > 9 then digit = digit - 9 and store to sum
  - Store sum of unused digits to sum (invert previous method used)
  - If sum % 10 = 0 then valid card
  - Finally, create as function and prompt for input

#### Step 1 Brainstorm and Basics
Sum every other number from right to left
(num = _some number_)
```
num_list = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
(sum(num_list[::-2]))
```
Same as above, but starting from second to last number
```
start_index = len(num_list) - 2
(sum(num_list[start_index::-2]))
```
Multiplying items in list and addiing digits of results
```
num_new = []
for i in num_list:
    num_new.append(i * 2)

for n, i in enumerate(num_new):
    if i > 9:
        num_new[n] = i - 9
(sum(num_new))
```
Alternative solution - defining function to sum every other digit right to left:
```
def customSum(n):
    s = 0
    while n:#ask about this while n
        s += n % 10
        n //= 100
    return s
```
