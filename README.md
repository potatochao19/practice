## Hello!

2/11/19

After starting and restarting my Codeacademy course, I decided to try a new approach. Inspired by "100 days of coding" and r/getdisciplined/, I'm turning this interest into concrete skills!

I have no prior python experience. I use SQL and data visualization tools for work, and would like to increase my data literacy through Python. I also want to build useful tools for both personal and professional use. 

#### What I'm Learning From
- Corey Schafer videos
- edx CS50 Course
- edx Intro to Computer Programming with Python
- Automate the Boring Stuff
- Podcast for fun: Talk Python to Me

#### Goals
- Build daily habits
- Build simple apps 
- Data analysis with Python

Thanks!
